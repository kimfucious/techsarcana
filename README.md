# Techsarcana

This is a static website built with Hugo.

It's main purpose is to explain complex programming-centric, technical topics hopefully better than I have seen them explained before.

Mostly, I've written (and will write) these for myself as I try to understand something new, or re-learn something I've forgotten, or when realizing I never actually understood something quite that well at all.

Often I write these because the explanations that I've found on certain topics are confounding.

It's my hope that someone might come across one of these write-ups and actually get something good out of it.

Enjoy :rainbow: :unicorn:
